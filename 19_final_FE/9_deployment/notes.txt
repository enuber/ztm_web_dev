// environment variables

have access to variables that are specific for the server 
running a console log will show the environment.

console.log(process.env)


PORT here is made up, it doesn't exist. But it an be defined in the terminal
const PORT = process.env.PORT;

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is listening on port ${PORT}`);
});

in terminal run

PORT=3000 node server.js

usually environment variables are used to store things that are a secret.
