a database is a collection of data

can store and organize data that is useful. 

Database Management System - collection of programs that allows us to access databases and work with data. Allows control access to database users.


Relational Database -  (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite)
  consist of two or more tables with columns and rows. 

  a row represents an entry and a column sorts a very specific type of information

  the relation between tables is called a SCHEMA. The schema needs to be defined before data is placed.

  Primary Key: Something that identifies each row is called the primary key. Like ID, Create_At, Full_Name

  Foreign Key: if two tables have a common element like username, it is a foreign key where username in one table is the foreign key for another table. 

SQL - allows you to communicate from database to the server. 

for relational DB's, files would be like "users" "tweets" "profiles" and you use foreign keys to relate to one another to grab info. So if you have a user with an ID and username, you can look at tweets by the username in another file, and, then from ID see who is following that ID...

a realional db table organizes structured data fields into defined columns.


Non Relational Database or NoSQL (MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Apache HBase, Hypertable, Apache CouchDB)
don't have to define the schema first. Good for unstructured data, has greater flexibility. 

does not incorporate the table model, instead data is stored in a single document file. 

For this, each user is a separate file that contains all the info about that user. 

uses for example MongoDB query language to talk to server so not same as SQL.
