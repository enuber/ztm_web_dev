// this creates a package.json file
npm init

// get newest version of node
visit the nodejs site and you can update from the downloads section using the Bash area. Need the LTS for the latest stable version.

// globally or locally
if local will only work in the project you are working
-g global will work everywhere so will work from project to project 


VIDEO - INSTALLING AND USING PACKAGES

// this would be locally, will create a node_modules folder and add the correct material to the package.json folder. 

ex:
npm install lodash


note: if require method is not working you may need to instal browserify

npm install -g browserify

to run browserify

browserify script.js > bundle.js
add the bundle.js file to html 

dependencies vs dev-dependencies

dev-dependencies are only for development, when the project is released those packages aren't needed to run anything on the page. 

npm scripts allow you to write some code that will auto run like this will rebuild the script to bundle then load live-server
build: 'browserify script.js > bundle.js && live-server'
