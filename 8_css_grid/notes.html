<!-- CSS Grid is a powerful layout system in CSS that allows you to create complex, responsive web layouts with ease. It uses a two-dimensional grid-based approach, meaning you can control both columns and rows, making it suitable for creating web pages with intricate and flexible designs.

Key Concepts of CSS Grid
Grid Container: The element that serves as the container for the grid items. You define a grid container by setting its display property to grid or inline-grid.

Grid Items: The direct children of the grid container. These items are automatically placed into the grid cells created by the container.

Grid Lines: The horizontal and vertical lines that divide the grid into cells.

Grid Tracks: The columns and rows of the grid.

Grid Cell: The space between two adjacent row and two adjacent column grid lines.

Grid Area: A rectangular space between four grid lines. It can span multiple cells.

Basic Usage
1. Defining a Grid Container
You start by defining a grid container. For example:

css
Copy code
.container {
  display: grid;
}

2. Creating Columns and Rows
You use the grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows properties to define the number and size of the columns and rows:

css
Copy code
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 100px 200px 100px; /* Three columns with specified widths */
  grid-template-rows: auto 100px auto; /* Three rows with specified heights */
}


Alternatively, you can use repeat() to simplify your code:

css
Copy code
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); /* Three columns of equal width */
  grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 200px); /* Two rows of equal height */
}


3. Placing Grid Items
Grid items are placed automatically, but you can also specify their placement using properties like grid-column and grid-row:

css
Copy code
.item1 {
  grid-column: 1 / 3; /* Span from column line 1 to 3 */
  grid-row: 1 / 2; /* Span from row line 1 to 2 */
}

Example
Here is a simple example to illustrate the concepts:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>CSS Grid Example</title>
  <style>
    .container {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); /* Three equal columns */
      grid-template-rows: 100px 200px; /* Two rows, first 100px, second 200px */
      gap: 10px; /* Space between grid items */
    }
    .item {
      background-color: lightblue;
      padding: 20px;
      text-align: center;
    }
    .item1 {
      grid-column: 1 / 3; /* Span across the first two columns */
    }
    .item2 {
      grid-row: 1 / 3; /* Span across the first two rows */
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="item item1">Item 1</div>
    <div class="item item2">Item 2</div>
    <div class="item">Item 3</div>
    <div class="item">Item 4</div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>



More Advanced Features
Grid Template Areas: Define areas of the grid and place items into these areas by name.

css
Copy code
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas: 
    'header header header'
    'sidebar main main'
    'footer footer footer';
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
}

.header {
  grid-area: header;
}
.sidebar {
  grid-area: sidebar;
}
.main {
  grid-area: main;
}
.footer {
  grid-area: footer;
}
Auto-placement: Let the browser automatically place grid items.

css
Copy code
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-auto-columns: 100px;
  grid-auto-rows: 100px;
}
CSS Grid offers a flexible and powerful way to create complex and responsive layouts, making it an essential tool for modern web development.



In CSS Grid, you can use the justify-items property to control the alignment of grid items along the inline (row) axis. This property can be applied to the grid container to set a default alignment for all items within the grid.

justify-items Property
The justify-items property accepts the following values:

start: Aligns items to the start of their grid area (default).
end: Aligns items to the end of their grid area.
center: Aligns items to the center of their grid area.
stretch: Stretches items to fill their grid area (default if no size is specified).



In CSS Grid, the align-items property is used to control the alignment of grid items along the block (column) axis. This property can be applied to the grid container to set a default alignment for all items within the grid.

align-items Property
The align-items property accepts the following values:

start: Aligns items to the start of their grid area.
end: Aligns items to the end of their grid area.
center: Aligns items to the center of their grid area.
stretch: Stretches items to fill their grid area (default if no size is specified).
